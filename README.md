Multi-Agent Generative AI Stock Market Simulation
Overview

This project is a multi-agent stock market simulation powered by Generative AI, designed to study emergent market behavior arising from heterogeneous, autonomous trading agents.

The simulation models a virtual stock market with:

Two tradable stocks (Stock A and Stock B)

50 AI-powered trader agents, each with distinct personalities and risk profiles

A full 264 trading-day cycle (one trading year)

Agents make independent buy, sell, or hold decisions based on personality, market conditions, capital constraints, news events, and learned behavior—resulting in realistic price dynamics, volatility, and market shocks.

Key Features
Virtual Market Environment

Two stocks with dynamically evolving prices

Supply-and-demand-driven price formation

Market behavior influenced by agent actions and external news events

AI Trading Agents (50 Total)

Each agent is uniquely parameterized with:

Risk appetite ranging from conservative to aggressive

Trading strategies including momentum, contrarian, random, news-driven, and long-term investing

Capital and liquidity constraints

Decision-making driven by Generative AI reasoning

Trading Timeline

264 trading days

Daily market opening, trading, and closing cycles

Emergence of long-term trends and short-term volatility

Advanced Market Mechanics
News and Events System

Random and scheduled news events

Positive and negative sentiment impacts on Stock A and/or Stock B

Agents interpret news differently based on personality traits

Loans and Interest

Agents can borrow capital during liquidity shortages

Interest accrues on borrowed capital daily

Highly leveraged agents face increased bankruptcy risk

Bankruptcy and Market Exit

Agents unable to service debt or maintain minimum capital are declared bankrupt

Bankrupt agents exit the market

Market liquidity and volatility adjust dynamically

Simulation Outputs

The system tracks and logs:

Daily stock prices for Stock A and Stock B

Trading volume

Individual agent portfolio values

Loan balances and interest accumulation

Bankruptcy events

Market-wide statistics

These outputs support:
